    <section>
        <p>I have started programming computer games since age 11. I have over
          <span class="years" data-since="2003">15</span> years of experience managing and
          developing web start-ups. I'm most comfortable coding in JavaScript, Python and C++, in
          which I have a solid foundation and dynamic skill set, but also have experience in
          React.js, AWS, Cryptography, MongoDB, MySQL, PHP, Java and similar technologies.</p>

      <p>I graduated with a Bachelor's degree from
        <a href="http://new.huji.ac.il/en" target="_blank">the Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>,
        and have since worked in several positions with teams of varying size.
        I'm an entrepreneur in my blood and always looking for new ways to scale and improve things.
        My biggest inspiration in life is the nature evolution process and I try to implement it
        on my day-to-day actions.
      </p>

        <p>Right now I'm working <a href="https://neuledge.com" target="_blank">on my own start-up</a>
          and doing some freelancing work for a few clients. Please feel free to contact me on any
          topic.</p>
